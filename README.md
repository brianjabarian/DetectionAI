# DetectionAI

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and data tables used to study detection of AI-generated text. The notebooks explore different detection strategies and present results for various detection thresholds.

## Repository Contents
- **Code_detection.ipynb** – baseline detection notebook.
- **Code_new_detection_withStealthgpt.ipynb** – experiments using the StealthGPT dataset.
- **Code_shorter_text_analysis.ipynb** – analysis of short text samples.
- **Code_statistics_part.ipynb** – helper notebook with statistics utilities.
- **CSV files** – tables of detection results used in the notebooks.

## Usage
Open any of the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis. The notebooks were originally run in Google Colab, but they can also be executed locally with a standard Python environment that includes common data science libraries such as pandas and numpy.
